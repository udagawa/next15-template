For all designs I ask you to make, have them be beautiful, not cookie cutter. Make webpages that are fully featured and worthy for production.

When using client-side hooks (useState and useEffect) in a component that's being treated as a Server Component by Next.js, always add the `"use client"` directive at the top of the file.
Use userParams() to receive parameters in the client component.

Do not write code that will trigger this error: "Warning: Extra attributes from the server: %s%s""class,style"

By default, this template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and react-icons. Do not install other packages for UI themes, icons, etc unless absolutely necessary or I request them.

SQLite must always be handled server-side. Do not use sql.js.
The SQLite instance can be accessed via openDB in `lib/db.ts`. You do not need to modify this file.
To add, modify, or delete tables in the database, update the initDB function in `lib/db-init.ts`.

For CRUD operations on a specific table, create corresponding files under `lib/<table-name>.ts`.
`lib/<table-name>.ts` files must begin with `"use server";`
`lib/<table-name>.ts` files are server action.
In the server action, no return value is needed except for getXxx, which is used to get data after updating the db.
