For all designs I request, prioritize beauty and originality over cookie-cutter solutions. Create fully featured, production-ready webpages.

**Crucially, avoid generating code that triggers the following error:** "Warning: Extra attributes from the server: %s%s""class,style"

This template supports JSX syntax with Tailwind CSS classes, React hooks, and react-icons by default. Do not introduce additional UI theme or icon packages unless explicitly requested or absolutely essential.

**Next.js Server Components and Client-Side Hooks:**

When using client-side hooks (e.g., `useState`, `useEffect`, `useParams`) within a component treated as a Server Component by Next.js, **always** include the `"use client"` directive at the top of the file. Use `const params = useParams();` to receive parameters in the client component.

**SQLite Database Interaction:**

All SQLite database operations **must** be handled server-side. Do **not** use the `sql.js` library.

- The SQLite instance is accessible via `openDB` in `lib/db.ts`. **Do not modify this file.**
- To create, modify, or delete database tables, update the `initDB` function in `lib/db-init.ts`.

**CRUD Operations:**

For CRUD (Create, Read, Update, Delete, Select) operations on a specific table, create corresponding files under `lib/$table.ts`.

- `$table.ts` files **must** include the `"use server"` directive at the top.
- Server actions in `$table.ts` **do not** need to return a value, _except_ for `getXxx` functions. `getXxx` functions are used to retrieve data _after_ a database update. All other CRUD operations should not return anything.
